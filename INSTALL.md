# Gevulot node installation guide

## Hardware system requirements

Gevulot node itself runs on modest resources. The real system HW requirements are dictated by the provers run on this platform.

Many ZK provers require modern multi-core processor and a lot of RAM. Some also need plenty of fast disk space.

Currently Gevulot supports nVidia 3090 and 4090 GPUs.

### Minimum requirements for devnet

- CPU: 64+ cores
- RAM: 512GB
- Disk: 1 TB NVMe

These requirements are formed by best estimate based on earlier documentation of production requirements for Polygon Hermez and Aztec provers, and empirical experience from working with Taiko prover. 

## Software system requirements

Gevulot node requires modern Linux distribution with systemd, quadlet and necessary KVM components (on Fedora this is provider by `qemu-kvm` package) installed.

Development & testing has been done on Fedora 39.

For GPU support the PCI passthrough must be appropriately configured. 

## PCI passthrough for GPU

### Blacklist nVidia drivers from loading during boot

When passing GPU to VM running unikernel, the device cannot be in use by the host operating system. Therefore the GPU drivers must be blacklisted.

**/etc/modprobe.d/nvidia.conf**
```
blacklist nvidia
blacklist nvidia-drm
```

### Load VFIO & VSOCK modules

[VFIO](https://docs.kernel.org/driver-api/vfio.html) provides framework for virtual machines to utilize host machine hardware directly, allowing high performance device access.

In Gevulot this is needed for direct access to GPU.

**/etc/modules-load.d/vfio.conf**
```
kvmgt
vfio-pci
vfio-iommu-type1
vfio-mdev
```

[VSOCK](https://nanovms.com/dev/tutorials/what-is-vsock-why-use-with-unikernels) provides high speed communication channel between Gevulot node and program running in VM.

**/etc/modules-load.d/vsock.conf**
```
vsock_vhost
```

### Configure GPU's PCI bus devices to be bound with VFIO 

Depending on specific construction of the GPU device card, there can be multiple PCI device entries on the bus.

In order to make PCI passthrough work with virtual machines, all devices present in PCI bus must be bound with VFIO driver.

Find out the device IDs of the GPU:
```
lspci -nnD | grep -i nvidia
```

**Example output:**
```
0000:01:00.0 VGA compatible controller [0300]: NVIDIA Corporation AD102 [GeForce RTX 4090] [10de:2684] (rev a1)
0000:01:00.1 Audio device [0403]: NVIDIA Corporation AD102 High Definition Audio Controller [10de:22ba] (rev a1)
```

In the above example output the first entry on the line is the PCI slot name. The second last column is the PCI ID.

Configure all PCI device IDs to VFIO:
**/etc/modprobe.d/vfio.conf**
```
options vfio-pci ids=10de:2684,10de:22ba
```


### Adjust VFIO device permissions with udev rule

By default, the VFIO group devices are only accessible by root. In order to allow Gevulot node be run as non-root, the VFIO group devices' permissions must be adjusted: 

**/etc/udev/rules.d/99-vfio.rules**
```
SUBSYSTEM=="vfio", OWNER="root", GROUP="kvm"
```

That will allow VFIO device access to all users who belong to `kvm` group.

### Further device driver adjustments

In some cases the GPU board might have devices which have drivers directly built into kernel and which cannot be blacklisted due to critical nature.

One such example is a USB controller embedded on GPU board.

Individual PCI device's driver attachment can be fixed in a following way:
```
echo "0000:01:00.2" | sudo tee /sys/bus/pci/drivers/xhci_hcd/unbind
echo "0000:01:00.2" | sudo tee /sys/bus/pci/drivers/vfio-pci/bind
```

The device specific string above is the PCI slot name (first record of `lspci -nnD`).

For persistent effect, create a systemd unit for this.

## Postgres

Gevulot node uses Postgres database for its operation. It has been tested to work with Postgres releases 15 and 16.

### Database migration

In order to create initial tables or perform latest migrations, run:
```
podman run -it --network=host quay.io/gevulot/node:latest migrate [--db-url=<DB URL>]
```

## Gevulot user

Gevulot node runs as a normal user. For privilege separation purposes, create a user for Gevulot.

In order to allow access to virtualization functionalities, add the user into `kvm` group.

## Gevulot node storage

Gevulot node requires plenty of storage for program images and their output data.

Create a directory on a volume with enough space.

This guide uses `/var/lib/gevulot`, which is also the default, but it is configurable.

## Gevulot node key

Each Gevulot node requires a keypair for operation. It can be generated with Gevulot node container:
```
podman run -it -v /var/lib/gevulot:/var/lib/gevulot:z quay.io/gevulot/node:latest generate node-key 
```

## Gevulot node systemd unit

Gevulot node is packaged as a container for best possible platform compatibility and it is recommended to run it with Podman Quadlet. 

Use following systemd unit as basis for running Gevulot node:
**/etc/containers/systemd/gevulot-node.container**
```
